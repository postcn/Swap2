// BAD SMELLS
// Data Class
// This class is mainly used for data storage and retrieval. There isn't much "functionality". Moving some behavior to the class would solve the issue.

//Swap 2 TEAM 04 - Refactoring for Enhancement
//I disagree with this just being a data class. We can see that it stores the information on a worker working and days that it worked,
//But it also contains methods for accessing and manipulating this data.

//However, we pull functionality from Schedule to make this less of a data class.
